            <p>The Sims 4 is a social simulation game developed by Maxis and 
                published by Electronic Arts. The game was released on September 2,
                 2014 for Windows, and is the fourth main installment in The Sims 
                 series, following The Sims 3 (2009). As with previous games in the 
                 series, The Sims 4 allows players to create and customize characters
                  called "Sims", build and furnish their homes, and simulate their 
                  daily life across various in-game regions. This installment introduced
                   a newly developed custom game engine, with enhanced character creation
                    and house-building tools, along with a more complex in-game simulation.</p>

            <img src="Images/Couch Play/sims_scenes1.jpg">
            <p>There's a blithe naivety to the way that life is presented in 
                The Sims that is either comforting or a little disturbing 
                depending on your mood. The series is softly apolitical in
                 the way that a Barbie house is apolitical, and by that I
                  mean that it isn't apolitical at all . The Sims is loaded
                   with assumptions about the way that people function and
                    about the way that success in life is gauged, but it 
                    feels churlish to point them out because it's all just
                     a bit of fun, isn't it. The Sims is set in a world
                     where buying things is always awesome and everybody 
                     is twenty-five until they're sixty. Regardless of environmental 
                     aesthetic, the series has always been functionally and fundamentally Californian.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Couch Play/sims_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>Which is fine. Ownership of a beautiful self-built home is a 
                perfectly fine fantasy to construct a game around, and given
                 that the last two games I reviewed were about butchering goblins
                  and disemboweling Nazis I'm not sure I'm in a position to pick
                   too many holes in it. Nonetheless, I came to The Sims 4 with a
                    desire to see the experience that I've enjoyed in the past 
                    deepened and complicated by new art and smarter characters. 
                    The verdict, on that count, is a partial success. The Sims 4 
                    inherits an enormous number of its predecessor's ideas, goals 
                    and structures. It is a sequel in a way that has become peculiar
                    to this series, a fresh start that truncates or removes a huge 
                    number of features from The Sims 3 and its expansions in order 
                    to begin the cycle all over again. In doing so, Maxis have rebuilt
                    the game to support a new graphical style, better animation, and 
                    an emotion system that changes the feel and flow of the game.

            <P>After comfortably sinking thirty hours into the game I cannot imagine
                 being without many of these new features. Multi-tasking is one.
                  In prior Sims games, your characters performed the tasks you set 
                  for them–or those they assigned themselves, based on need–as 
                  part of a queue. Now, that queue can accommodate multiple 
                  active tasks at once as long as doing so is physically possible.
                   Listening to music, for example, is something that a Sim 
                   can benefit from anywhere in range–because all they need 
                   are their ears. A sim that is cooking a meal can talk to 
                   their partner while they do it. They can paint and flirt, 
                   write a novel and discuss videogames, sit on the toilet and 
                   drink coffee. It feels totally natural, and Sims will, if 
                   left alone, occupy themselves with multiple tasks at once.
                    The days of steering a Sim from a rigid conversation to 
                    watch television in isolation are gone, and good riddance.</P>
