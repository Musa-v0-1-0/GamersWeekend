            <p>Tiny Glade is a cosy, sandbox city-building game (more specifically, a diorama builder)
                 where players can construct castles, ruins, and other buildings from the 
                 medieval era. It was developed and published by Pounce Light and was 
                 released on 23 September 2024 for Windows. Many reviewers describe this as a 'cosy game'.</p>

            <img src="Images/Couch Play/Glade_scenes1.jpg">
            <p>Tiny Glade is a game about building rustic old abodes in idyllic pastorals.
                 There are no challenges, there is no narrative, nothing is unlockable and 
                 nothing is at stake. This is a meditative digital play object made for 
                 tinkering. It's a creative sandbox with firm boundaries designed to make
                  even the most perfunctory effort yield "beautiful" results.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Couch Play/Glade_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>The toolset is surprisingly slim. Building your grand or modest
                 ol' manor, or castle, or rundown, is a matter of pressing either 
                 rectangular or cylindrical structures together, adjusting their 
                 heights and girths, choosing from over a dozen colour schemes,
                  and then applying cosmetics like windows, chimneys and lamps.
                  Terrain can be elevated, paths, fences and brick barriers can
                   be built, and lakes and gardens can be applied to the earth like spray paint.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Couch Play/Glade_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>It all feels a bit limiting until the interplay of building
                 elements reveals itself. For example, if I build a path through
                  a stone wall, an arch will emerge. Even better: if I run a path
                   through the length of a stone wall, a pleasant viaduct-style 
                   ruin will result. Elsewhere, if I build three stained glass
                    windows side-by-side, a larger and fancier stained glass window 
                    will replace them. Thanks to the free-roaming camera, I can get 
                    up close and personal with my remote little outpost, and I can
                     even enter first-person mode if I want to properly mosey through my little Edens.</P>
