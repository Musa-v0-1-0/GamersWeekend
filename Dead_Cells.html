            <p>Dead Cells is a 2018 roguelike-Metroidvania game developed 
                by Motion Twin and Evil Empire, and published by Motion Twin. 
                The player takes the role of an amorphous creature called the Prisoner. 
                As the Prisoner, the player must fight their way out of a 
                diseased island in order to slay the island's King. 
                The player gains weapons, treasure and other tools through 
                exploration of the procedurally-generated levels. 
                Dead Cells features a permadeath system, causing the player 
                to lose all items and other abilities upon dying. A currency 
                called Cells can be collected from defeated enemies, allowing the 
                player to purchase permanent upgrades.</p>

            <p>Dead Cells has robust DNA. This is an action platformer with Castlevania’s 
                intricate environments and gothic bestiary, wed to Dark Souls’ exploratory 
                structure and sense of risk. From Diablo it inherits weapons with randomised 
                effects and deep combo potential, and from Spelunky it learns how to create 
                that ‘just one more run’ feeling with new surprises and challenges to discover 
                the deeper you go. This is an ambitious act of synthesis, successful because 
                each of its component pieces has been executed beautifully.</p>

            <img src="Images/Metroidvania/deadcells_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>It’s gorgeous, for a start. Smooth animation, evocative pixel 
                art and gratifying effects cast Dead Cells in a good light from 
                the off. Its moody fortresses and haunted villages are atmospheric 
                but never drab, and each zone introduces a new splash of colour to 
                the game’s palette. Defeated enemies erupt in a shower of glinting 
                gems and weapons strike with gratifying force thanks to on-point sound design.</p>

            <img src="Images/Metroidvania/deadcells_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>These touches gild a superbly-executed movement and combat system. 
                You have a double-jump and a dodge-roll that grants a brief but 
                vital window of invincibility. You can chain these into mid-air 
                dodges and powerful ground-slam attacks. You can bust through 
                wooden doors to stun enemies with a satisfying crunch and leap 
                from chains to dodge projectiles and reach new areas—and that’s 
                without factoring in your arsenal.</P>
