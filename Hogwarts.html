            <p>Hogwarts Legacy is a 2023 action role-playing game 
                developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. 
                Games under its Portkey Games label. It is part of the Wizarding 
                World franchise, taking place a century prior to the Harry Potter novels.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/hogwarts_scenes1.jpg">
            <p>I was over 20 hours into Hogwarts Legacy before it revealed that, 
                on top of being an expansive RPG with skill trees, wizard combat, 
                crafting, environmental puzzles, and loads of sidequests, 
                it's also a quaint home decorating game with a splash of zoo management. 
                This is a much larger game than I think anyone was anticipating and as 
                I've completed the main quest and dozens of sidequests over 50 hours, 
                I'm still surprised by how good each individual element is.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/hogwarts_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>It certainly suffers from a meandering start and distracting technical issues, 
                but once I was set free to explore the entirety of Hogwarts and miles of 
                countryside surrounding it, I enjoyed Hogwarts Legacy in the same ways I 
                did The Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2: moseying across a convincingly 
                rendered world at my own pace, letting myself disappear into a character I'm 
                increasingly invested in.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/hogwarts_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>Like those open-world classics I just mentioned, Hogwarts Legacy is a game 
                you've probably played before, but also a rarity: a big-budget RPG 
                attempting to bottle up all of the prestige, splendor, and expectations 
                of a massive media property into a seamless sandbox. For the most part, 
                it nails it. This is Harry Potter's Arkham Asylum momentâ€”a game telling 
                its own story in an established world, unshackled by the restrictive deadlines 
                and creative boundaries of a movie tie-in, created by a studio that was itself 
                once relegated to obligatory marketing products like Toy Story 3: The Video Game.</P>
