            <p>Rain World is a 2017 survival platform game developed by 
                Videocult and published by Adult Swim Games and Akupara Games for 
                PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in March 2017, and for Nintendo 
                Switch in late 2018. Players assume control of a "slugcat", 
                an elongated felid-like rodent, and are tasked with survival 
                in a derelict and hostile world.</p>

            <img src="Images/Metroidvania/rain_scenes1.jpg">
            <p>Rain World looks to be set in a fairly commonplace videogame 
                post-apocalypse at first. Wild vegetation grows from mysterious structures, 
                the skeletons of skyscrapers scratch a leaden grey sky, and 
                living is neither convenient nor fun. Except in Rain World you’re a 
                slugcat (a cat that is also a slug), and the apocalypse it must endure 
                is among the bleakest and most punishing I’ve ever experienced. 
                You’re not punching trees to build abodes, you’re not meeting warring 
                survivor factions and buddying up, you’re not grinding for a nice pair 
                of trousers. You’re just surviving, by a thread. And it’s hard to do that.</p>

            <img src="Images/Metroidvania/rain_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>It’s a platformer and a survival game, but neither of those categories
                 are a neat fit for Rain World’s peculiar brand of misery. There are
                  traces of other games’ DNA, such as the original Dark Souls’ bonfire 
                  system and the roaming, improvisational foes of Alien: Isolation, but 
                  Rain World stands apart as one of the most alienating and difficult games 
                  in recent memory, previously mentioned company included.</p>

            <img src="Images/Metroidvania/rain_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>There’s little exposition: you’re the aforementioned slugcat, 
                wrestled away from its family and plunged into a decayed urban 
                dreamscape plagued with erratic, free-roaming monstrosities that 
                want to eat you. As a slugcat you’re close to the bottom of the food chain, 
                but not rock bottom: you’ll need to eat bats to survive, or more accurately, 
                eat in order to hibernate. Hibernating can only be done in hibernation chambers, 
                and one must have at least four units of food in order to use them. 
                These chambers are infrequent, with each rest cycling to a different 
                season in-world. Seasons work like a ladder: hibernate without dying, 
                and you’ll move up. Die, and you’ll move down. This process is agonising, 
                but I won’t spoil why.</P>
