            <p>Nine Sols is a 2D action-platformer, metroidvania developed 
                and published by Red Candle Games. The game is set in an Asian 
                fantasy-inspired futuristic world which Red Candle Games describes 
                as "taopunk", a combination of Taoism and cyberpunk, stating that 
                “we had a clear goal of combining Taoism with cyberpunk, melding 
                sci-fi elements with Eastern mythology." In gameplay, combat 
                emphasizes the player deflecting attacks from enemies to build up 
                energy to perform special attacks. It features a hand-drawn animation style. 
                The game was released on Microsoft Windows and macOS on 
                May 29, 2024, which will be followed by home console ports on November 26.</p>

            <p>Am I seriously arguing this game can follow Shadow of the Erdtree and 
                make the eternal wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong bearable? 
                Absolutely. At time of writing, I’m 25 hours in and yet to finish Nine Sols.
                 But unless it ends with my PC exploding, this will likely be my game of the year.
                  Even if that does happen, I’ll probably still recommend it.</p>

            <p>Nine Sols is a soulslike metroidvania that… wait, wait, come back!
                 Yes, half the 2D games out there fall into that genre these days,
                  but this one stands out by taking its influence from Sekiro, the 
                  least idea-plundered of FromSoftware’s games. It's all about nailing 
                  different types of parry, including doing it in mid-air. Too stubborn 
                  to learn to parry properly? You'll need to crank the difficulty right down, 
                  because Nine Sols’ block-or-be-broken combat is just as pleasingly 
                  unrelenting as its main inspiration.</p>

            <img src="Images/Metroidvania/ninesols_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>The most obvious difference from Sekiro is that it’s 2D, and what it lacks 
                for in a third dimension it makes up for by being one of the most beautiful 
                2D games I’ve ever played. Gorgeous animation is a spectacular treat for the 
                eyeballs one moment, and absolutely gut-wrenching the next when the game starts,
                 well, wrenching out guts. It actually starts quite cuddly with an adorable young boy
                  walking you through the opening village to their annual ritual. A ritual which involves
                   a machine decapitating several villagers.</P>
