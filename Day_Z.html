            <p>DayZ is a multiplayer only survival video game developed 
                and published by Bohemia Interactive. It is the standalone 
                game based on the mod of the same name for Arma 2. 
                Following a five-year-long early access period for Windows, 
                the game was officially released in December 2018, and was released 
                for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2019.</p>

            <p>December, 2013. Barack Obama is in the White House. 
                ‘Wrecking Ball’ by Miley Cyrus is topping the charts. 
                The Harlem Shake is taking the internet by storm. And DayZ,
                 a zombie survival game, hits Steam Early Access. Part survival sandbox,
                  part social experiment, the game throws 64 players into a bleak zombie 
                  apocalypse, sits back, and lets them make their own fun.</p>

            <p>Five years later and DayZ, having gone through an extended Early Access period, 
                is finally out. And, well, nothing much has changed. There’s something comforting 
                about the fact that DayZ is still DayZ, with its clunky controls, buggy zombies, 
                and commitment to making surviving as hard as possible. It’s kinda absurd that, 
                in a 1.0 release, there are still problems that have been stubbornly lingering since 
                the alpha days. But honestly, I wasn’t expecting much else. For better or worse, it’s the game I remember.</p>

            <img src="Images/Survival/dayZ_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>You still have to run for miles to meet up with friends. The zombies still 
                get stuck in walls or just completely fail to notice you at all. You can scour 
                an entire town for supplies only to find one dirty jacket, a tin opener, 
                and no tins. And the chances that you’ll be killed by some unseen sniper, 
                usually seconds after you finally find something good, is always high. 
                At least those damn ladders have finally been sorted out. 
                Veteran players will remember the agony of climbing a ladder and ending 
                up inexplicably dead at the bottom of it.</P>
