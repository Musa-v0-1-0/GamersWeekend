            <p>Forza Horizon 4 is a 2018 racing video game developed by 
                Playground Games and published by Microsoft Studios. 
                It was released on 2 October 2018 for Windows and Xbox 
                One after being announced at Xbox's E3 2018 conference. 
                An enhanced version of the game was released on Xbox Series X/S 
                on 10 November 2020.</p>

            <p>It's autumn. The fields and fells are a rolling sea of reds, 
                browns and yellows. Light rain falls on the screen, and the 
                small puddles shimmer in the sunset as I drive across the 
                windswept grasslands, skid through a wall, and drift across 
                picturesque farmland, catching a hill at just the right angle 
                to lift off the ground—raising my skill chain combo. 
                It's beautiful and it's absurd, and, next week, it will all be different.</p>

            <p>Forza Horizon 4 is built around seasons. In its opening moments you 
                drive a McLaren Senna across autumnal country roads, race a Polaris 
                RZR across a frozen winter lake, skid through mud in a Ford Fiesta in spring, 
                before hopping back into the Senna for a road trip on a clear summer's day. 
                It's a montage of the series' trademark aspirational playground, 
                here tailored to maximise the differences between its seasonal shifts.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/forza_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>It's an emotive tour through what's to come. Once you reach the festival site, 
                you play through each season individually across a five-hour prologue that 
                introduces Forza Horizon 4's many different events. Had this been the game proper, 
                it would have been enough. You complete events to build influence, 
                hitting milestones to progress to the next season in a manner similar to 
                unlocking new festival sites in Forza Horizon 3. But after you've completed 
                a full loop—summer to spring—Forza Horizon 4 reveals its final form.</P>
