            <p>Dale & Dawson Stationery Supplies is a social deduction game set in an 
                office environment. Each player takes on the role of an employee of a 
                company, where some are "slackers", while the others are "specialists".
                One player becomes a "manager", having to fire an employee – hopefully a 
                slacker – within a time limit. Should the manager not fire anyone within 
                the time limit, they are fired instead. The player who gets fired first becomes
                a janitor, while the rest may spectate the game. The game is over once there are
                 more slackers than specialists, once all slackers are fired, or once the office
                  is regarded as fully or not-at-all productive.</p>

            <p>An indie social game called Dale & Dawson Stationery Supplies is
                 getting a bit of buzz on Steam this past week, casting players 
                 as managers and specialists in an office trying get their work 
                 done while rooting out perfidious slackers, who'll ensure that
                  productivity is in the toilet and the company goes bust.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Couch Play/dd_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>It seems straightforward, but it clearly has some sauce: With 1,292 Steam
                 user reviews since it released on August 30, 95% of them are positive 
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Couch Play/dd_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>During each round the manager has the simplest job: Ensure
                 that specialists are doing their jobs while rooting out
                  any slackers and dealing with office disasters that come
                  up—like wastebasket fires. The specialists meanwhile are 
                  supposed to keep the office running and narc on any slackers
                   they see not working—the trick is that theyre mostly assigned
                    work tasks but even a productive worker sometimes has to take
                     a coffee break or use the bathroom.</P>
