            <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by the Polish 
                studio CD Projekt Red, and published by CD Projekt, and based on Mike 
                Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. The plot is set in the fictional 
                metropolis of Night City, California, within the dystopian Cyberpunk universe. 
                The player assumes the role of V, a mercenary who accidentally gets imbued with 
                a cybernetic "bio-chip" containing an engram of legendary rockstar and terrorist 
                Johnny Silverhand. As Johnny's behaviour and memories begin overwriting V's own,
                 the two must work together to separate from each other and save V's life.</p>

            <p>I'm on an aimless walking tour of Night City. Somehow I've ended up in the 
                Japantown neighborhood's Arasaka-financed streets, where animated billboards
                 for "Sweet Clean Speed" and pornographic braindances climb the flanks of 
                 utilitarian skyscrapers, blotting out the stars with a rainbow of neon. 
                 I pass a ramen shop, a hot dog stand, and a man selling spice, piles of 
                 garbage tucked beneath the offramp behind him.  
            </p>

            <p>A mob of Christians gather at a nearby intersection, waving signs and 
                screaming "Blasphemers!" at the cops. A voice makes booming proclamations
                 in Japanese from loudspeakers overhead, flying cars crisscrossing the 
                 invisible roads between buildings. The sky glows with light pollution, 
                 but the moon is full and clear. It's a beautiful night. 
            </p>

            <P>I just left Judy Alvarez's place. My friend's been through a lot lately.
                 Someone close to her has been victim to a string of horrors including sexual assault,
                  physical trauma, and suicidal tendencies. We had a big heart-to-heart about it, 
                  undermined by the presence of elaborate arm-knife crosshairs fixed on her forehead
                   even though I put my arm-knives away earlier (I'm polite like that).
                    There was also the notification from that fancy sniper rifle I picked
                    up 20 minutes ago, still notifying me that I picked up a sniper rifle. 
                    Duly noted, notification.</P>
