            <p>Sky: Children of the Light (shortened to Sky in-game) is a social adventure 
                game by Thatgamecompany. It was first released for iOS on July 18, 2019.

                 version was released on June 29, 2021, followed by a PlayStation 4 release on 
                 December 6, 2022, and a Microsoft Windows release via Steam Early Access on
                  April 10, 2024. A separate version of the game was released for Mainland China

            <p>I'll admit I still know less than three things about Moomin even after
                 playing a bit of Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley earlier this year, 
                 but I'm in the minority there. Originally created by Finnish artist
                  Tove Jansson, the little hippo-shaped creatures and friends are rather beloved worldwide.

            <p>A mob of Christians gather at a nearby intersection, waving signs and 
                screaming "Blasphemers!" at the cops. A voice makes booming proclamations
                 in Japanese from loudspeakers overhead, flying cars crisscrossing the 
                 invisible roads between buildings. The sky glows with light pollution, 
                 but the moon is full and clear. It's a beautiful night.

            <P>"This season brings to life the touching tale of Ninny, 'The Invisible Child,'
                 from the 1962 Tales of Moominvalley," Thatgamecompany says, and that the
                  upcoming season "celebrates the importance of being true to yourself
                   and overcoming obstacles from childhood." Thatgamecompany definitely 
                   has a habit of picking tearjerker stories and this sounds like no exception.
                    Ninny is a girl who became invisible after being mistreated by her caretaker
                     and gets spirited away to stay with the Moomin family, explains the official Moomin site.</P>
