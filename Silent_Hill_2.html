            <p>Silent Hill 2 is a 2001 survival horror game developed by Team Silent,
                 a group in Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, and published by Konami.
                  The game was released from September to November, originally for 
                  the PlayStation 2. The second installment in the Silent Hill series,
                   Silent Hill 2 centers on James Sunderland, a widower who journeys to 
                   the town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his dead wife.
                    An extended version containing a bonus scenario, Born from a Wish, 
                    and other additions was published for Xbox in December of the same year.
                     In 2002, it was ported to Windows and re-released for the PlayStation 2
                      as a Greatest Hits version, which includes all bonus content from the 
                      Xbox port. A remastered high-definition version was released for the
                       PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012 as part of the Silent Hill HD Collection.
                        A remake developed by Bloober Team was released on October 8, 2024.</p>

            <p>I don't envy Bloober Team. Nobody actually wants the difficult 
                task of updating something as nuanced, emotionally sensitive, 
                and revered as Silent Hill 2. The original has been praised for 
                decades, and picked apart by fans eager to understand every 
                last detail for just as long. It's a game where every strange 
                texture and odd room decoration means something, the game's unforgettable
                 atmosphere held together by the finest of threads. 
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Story Rich/sh2_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>This modern remake of that legendary tale gets off to a great start,
                 offering an extensive range of graphical settings and accessibility options. 
                 It doesn't take long to tweak the game into a smoothly running raytraced
                  beauty, or to adjust the controls and their behaviour so they're just 
                  the way I like them. A personal favourite is the option to swap the 
                  standard 'mash to get monsters off me' action for a simple button hold
                   instead—a small gesture that allowed me to concentrate on the horrors
                    around me instead of being distracted by an aching thumb. 
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Story Rich/sh2_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>Those horrors look impressively familiar, even decades removed from 
                the game's PlayStation 2 debut. The rust-covered hellscapes, 
                the signage, the glistening sacks of flesh scuttling past 
                locked-up homes tumbling into the abyss—it's easy to believe
                Silent Hill 2 always looked this good, but that illusion takes a lot of hard work.</P>
