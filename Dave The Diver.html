            <p>Dave the Diver is a 2023 video game developed and published by Mintrocket.
                 The game combines both action-adventure and management gameplay styles as
                  players explore deep sea environments to gather ingredients for a sushi
                   restaurant. It was released for macOS and Windows in June 2023 following 
                   an early access release in October 2022. A Nintendo Switch version was
                    released in October 2023. A version for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 
                    was released in April 2024.</p>

            <p>How it started: Oh, this looks like a cute, simple little fishing and
                 restaurant management game. I bet it'll be great on my Steam Deck.   
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Story Rich/dtd_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>How it's going: Oh, this is easily the best game of 2023.
                 I'm routinely up playing until 2 am, even after 30 hours 
                 it's still throwing fun and creative new systems at me,
                  and every time I play I'm delighted, surprised, and utterly charmed.  
            </p>

            <P>In 2D pixel adventure Dave the Diver, you split your time between 
                spearfishing in a colorful patch of ocean and using the fish you 
                catch in the sushi restaurant you manage. It's simple at first: 
                Each day you spend the morning and afternoon swimming around in scuba gear,
                 minding your oxygen supply, impaling fish with a harpoon and reeling them 
                 in, and collecting crafting resources and other ingredients like seaweed 
                 from the reef. The diving is a delight, mostly a chill and soothing experience 
                 with colorful fish darting here and there and kelp gently swaying in the ocean 
                 currentsâ€”though that relaxing vibe can abruptly turn into a frenzied panic as a 
                 sawtooth shark tries to cut you in half or a pelican eel tries to swallow you 
                 whole before you escape to surface with your precious haul.
