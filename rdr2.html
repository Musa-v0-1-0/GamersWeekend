            <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game 
                developed and published by Rockstar Games. The game 
                is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a prequel 
                to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/rdr2_scenes1.jpg">
            <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 does not start off how you would expect. 
                There are no endless vistas of scraggy desert, broken up by the 
                occasional cactus. No vultures circling overhead or decrepit 
                ranches to explore. Instead, there’s snow. A lot of snow. 
                The year is 1899 – 12 years before the events of Red Dead Redemption – 
                and Dutch Van der Linde’s gang of ill-mannered misfits are 
                trudging into the mountains after a disastrous heist in the 
                nearby town of Blackwater. The snow is waist-high and still 
                falling in a thick, heavy blanket. A far cry from the wide-open 
                panoramas of the last game, you can barely see the hoof prints 
                your horse leaves in the snow a few metres behind you.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/rdr2_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>The story is just as bleak. Right from the off, you find that one 
                of your fellow gang members hasn’t survived the journey and another – 
                John Marston, the protagonist from the previous game – has 
                been savaged by wolves and needs rescuing. Food is scarce and 
                the law is always just around the corner. If the Van der Linde 
                gang is going to survive in the barely-tamed west, then they’d better stick together.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/rdr2_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>You play as Arthur Morgan, a grizzled and emotionally-stunted enforcer who has been 
                with the Van der Linde gang since childhood. As with John Marston, 
                Morgan’s moral universe is painted entirely in various shades of grey. 
                “We’re bad men, but we ain’t them,” he says after a run-in with a rival gang. 
                Morality runs through the entire game, even doing small favours for a passerby 
                can boost Morgan’s honour rating, earning him discounts in certain stores. 
                At other times, the moral choices are more stark: kill a trio of hostages or 
                let them go, help an old friend out on an errand or turn away.</P>
