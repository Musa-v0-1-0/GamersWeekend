            <p>Hades is a 2020 roguelike action role-playing game developed and 
                published by Supergiant Games. It was released for macOS, Nintendo Switch,
                 and Windows following an early access release in December 2018.
                  It was later released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,
                   and Xbox Series X/S in August 2021, and was released for iOS in March
                    2024 through Netflix Games.</p>

            <p>Different as they are, Supergiant's previous games—Pyre, Transistor, 
                and Bastion—have all been summed up the same way. Story, art, music, 
                voice-acting, atmosphere? A+. Combat? Kind of B-. Hades feels like a 
                response to that, a Supergiant game that focuses on the fighting and 
                elevates it to the absolute top-tier. This isn't a spoiler because 
                you've looked at the score, but they nailed it. The combat's fantastic.

            <p>Hades doesn't short us on the other stuff either, though it easily could have.
                 It's a roguelike, or a roguelite, or an action-RPG with permadeath.
                  Whatever you call it, it's a genre where story is secondary,
                   either hidden away in the lore encyclopedia or otherwise in 
                   the back seat—the back seat of one of those cars with a window 
                   separating it from the driver.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Story Rich/hades_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>Not so in Hades, where every character is fully voiced and has more
                 to say with every run. You're Zagreus, son of the death god, 
                 prince of the underworld. You believe the whole "ruling in Hell"
                  thing is overrated, so with the help of your distant Olympian 
                  family you're going to fight through every shade, fury, and other
                   mythic monster between you and the surface to escape.
                    Because screw you, Dad, that's why.</P>
