            <p>Dead by Daylight is an online asymmetric multiplayer survival 
                horror video game developed and published by Canadian studio
                Behaviour Interactive. It is a one-versus-four game in which 
                one player takes on the role of a Killer and the other four play
                 as Survivors; the Killer must hunt and impale each Survivor on 
                 sacrificial hooks to appease a malevolent force known as the Entity, 
                 while the Survivors have to avoid being caught and power up the exit 
                 gates by working together to fix five generators.</p>

            <p>In the five years since Behaviour Interactive released Dead by Daylight on Steam, 
                the game has developed razor-sharp mechanical intrigue, an ultra-complex web of 
                versatile builds and strategies, and a diverse suite of characters, each equipped
                 with relative strengths and weaknesses. What was a comedy-horror romp mutated into 
                 something much closer to League of Legends and Dota 2 in terms of depth. It may 
                 be bewildering to consider that hardcore players can spend months scrutinizing 
                 the relative power-level and optimization path for Ghostface from Scream, but 
                 that's where Dead By Daylight finds itself at the beginning of 2021: an 
                 esports-worthy venture hosted by Freddy Kreuger, Bubba Sawyer, and Michael Myers.

            <p>Dead By Daylight launched with three distinct killers and a quartet of survivors. 
                Their unique abilities oozed with character—The Hillbilly, for instance, can
                 rev up his chainsaw into a murderous sprint—but the inflexibility of the roster 
                 ensured that the gauntlet played out in predictable ways. Nobody likes a villain
                  who never alters their devious plan, right? But as of this writing, Dead by Daylight 
                  includes 22 killers and 24 survivors, each of whom offer radically different toolkits.

            <P>Load up a match against The Huntress, a killer in a bloodstained bunny mask,
                 and expect to dodge the twirling hatchets that she can chuck across wide swathes
                  of the battlefield. Or perhaps you will face off against the famous Pyramid 
                  Head—yes, that one, from Silent Hill—who can banish his prey to Cages of Atonement,
                   which are particularly annoying to escape. </P>
