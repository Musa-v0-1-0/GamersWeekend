            <p>Rust is a multiplayer survival video game developed by Facepunch Studios.
                 It was first released in early access in December 2013 and received its 
                 full release in February 2018. Rust is available on Windows and macOS. 
                 Console versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One developed in conjunction 
                 with Double Eleven were released in May 2021. Rust was initially created 
                 as a clone of DayZ, a popular mod for ARMA 2, with crafting elements akin 
                 to those in Minecraft.</p>

            <p>Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. 
                You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no 
                narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the
                 unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your
                  rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some 
                  mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger 
                  pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. 
                  If you're particularly industrious, you'll have furnished a nice 
                  wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable 
                  resourcesâ€”the entry-level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign. 
            </p>

            <p>But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. 
                It's another idiot in Rust.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Survival/rust_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that
                 you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it's the brutal vastness 
                 of the design, or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad 
                 things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive 
                 effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, 
                 so when you're spotted by an idiot, you'll start hearing the shit-talk quietly 
                 tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, 
                 and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.</P>
