            <p>Limbus Company is an indie strategy role-playing video game for 
                Microsoft Windows and mobile devices using iOS or Android,
                 developed and published by South Korean studio Project Moon.
                  It was released worldwide on February 26, 2023. The game is
                   set in the same dystopian, hyper-capitalist world known only 
                   as "The City", where all of Project Moon's other works take place,
                    including Lobotomy Corporation, Library of Ruina, and multiple 
                    webcomics such as Leviathan and The Distortion Detective, but 
                    takes place some time after the events of all those stories.</p>

            <p>I wouldn't ever want to live in The City—the dystopian megalopolis
                 at the heart of Korean indie studio Project Moon's games,
                  comics and theme cafe—but it's a fascinating place to take
                   a road-trip through. That's exactly what I've been getting 
                   out of Limbus Company, the studio's third game and their 
                   first to not be Steam-exclusive. This ambitious RPG is
                    also on mobile. And free-to-play. And supported by gacha 
                    mechanics. And yes, I was as worried about that as you are.

            <p>After sinking around thirty hours into Limbus Company 
                (and not feeling the need to spend any money on it either), 
                I am very relieved to report that this is a perfectly valid 
                successor to Lobotomy Corporation and Library Of Ruina. It's dark, gory 
                and heavy on the dialogue and drama. It's also tough, complex and 
                rewarding for players willing to sit down and untangle its 
                often-confusing web of combat mechanics. It's about as hardcore
                 as mobile RPGs get, and far closer to its PC-only predecessors than its new peers.
            </p>

            <P>For complete newcomers to the world of Project Moon, Limbus
                 Company is equal parts visual novel and turn-based RPG combat,
                  a sequel to two other games, but mechanically and narratively 
                  all its own. In Limbus Company, a clock-headed amnesiac named 
                  Dante (you) leads a pack of twelve immortal 'Sinners' 
                  (a mismatched medley of eccentrics, each loosely based on a 
                  piece of classical literature or its author) on a quest to 
                  recover a series of techno-magical macguffins from abandoned
                   corporate 'dungeons' beneath a dystopian cyberpunk mega-city.
                    You also operate out of a carnivorous bus named Mephistopheles 
                    that must regularly be fed live human flesh. So, a normal corporate gig, then.</P>
