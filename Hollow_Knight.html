            <p>Hollow Knight is a 2017 Metroidvania video game developed 
                and published by independent developer Team Cherry. The 
                player controls the Knight, an insectoid warrior exploring Hallownest, 
                a fallen kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease. 
                The game is set in diverse subterranean locations, 
                featuring friendly and hostile insectoid characters and numerous bosses. 
                Players have the opportunity to unlock abilities as they explore,
                along with pieces of lore and flavour text that are spread throughout the kingdom.</p>

            <p>I'm in the middle of exploring a lush, green cavern called the Queen's 
                Garden when the ground gives way beneath my feet. Instead of hitting 
                spikes and resetting back to safety to try again, I just keep falling downward. 
                The leafy walls rush past, becoming dark rock and then web covered crags. 
                If I had found the double-jump ability by this point in Hollow Knight, 
                I could hop up to an exit path and continue exploring in the relative 
                safety of the Garden. But I haven’t, so I can’t. Instead, I have to 
                fight my way through a spider-filled hell for two hours. 
                Hallownest is an unforgiving place. </p>

            <p>It's also ridiculously huge. Hollow Knight is a 2D action-platformer 
                in the Metroidvania style, meaning it's centered around exploring 
                an open map, hunting for secrets, and finding abilities that let 
                you reach previously inaccessible areas. What makes it stand out, 
                above all else, is how expansive and detailed the dense subterranean 
                kingdom of Hallownest is. The uniquely-themed areas interlock with a 
                consistent logic that only reveals itself through exploration—everything 
                is built on that kingdom's fading history, the details of which are never 
                explained outright, instead living in the crumbling architecture and a few 
                folk left still living there. Its world design alone puts it at the top of the genre.</p>

            <P>Hollow Knight actually came out back in February and we didn't review it at the time, 
                which is a mistake I'm happy to correct. After nearly 35 
                hours of exploring Hallownest to reach 100% completion, 
                I can assure you it will never be too late to go back and play this wonderful game. </P>
