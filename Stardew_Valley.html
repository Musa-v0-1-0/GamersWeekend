            <p>Stardew Valley is a 2016 farm life simulation role-playing video game
                 developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. Players take the role of a
                  character who inherits their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm 
                  in a place known as Stardew Valley. The game was originally released
                   for Windows in February 2016 before being ported to other platforms.
                    Stardew Valley is an open-ended game, allowing players to grow crops, 
                    raise livestock, fish, cook, mine, forage, and socialize with the 
                    townspeople, including the ability to marry and have children.
                     It allows up to eight players to play online together.</p>

            <p>As a quiet person working in a loud, open-plan office the idea of 
                packing it all to go live on a farm appeals to me greatly. Stardew 
                Valley has given me that opportunity, albeit in a cutesy, pixelated form.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/Couch Play/stardew_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>It’s very much like a Harvest Moon game. You get your farm up
                 and running by first making a patch of land useable. Then you
                  plant, tend and ultimately sell crops to build up a stable income.
                   What starts off as a few parsnips soon becomes a steady supply of 
                   beans and potatoes, and then fancier products like eggs and mayonnaise.
                    You can supplement your earnings by heading out into the forest to 
                    forage for berries and leeks, or go fishing. Everything you do 
                    consumes energy so you’ll have to keep an eye on how much 
                    work you do or you’ll risk collapsing from exhaustion.
            </p>

            <P>There’s a town nearby filled with people to befriend and bargain with.
                 If you’re feeling particularly frisky, you can even woo some of them 
                 by giving them gifts. Unlike Harvest Moon games where the local town
                  seems to be filled with anime tropes and idiots, Stardew Valley’s
                   residents feel like they’d all actually live there. Everyone is a
                    little eccentric from living in such a small, isolated place, 
                    and some even feel depressed and unable to escape. 
                    he disheveled Shane with his dirty jumper and four-day stubble 
                    is particularly convincing. He spends most of his time drinking
                     in the bar wanting nothing to do with me—behaviour I’d expect 
                     from a grown man feeling trapped and trying to hide something.</P>
