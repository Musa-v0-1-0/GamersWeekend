            <p>Carto is a puzzle adventure game developed by Sunhead Games 
                and published by Humble Games in 2020. It was released in 
                October for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 
                and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/carto_scenes1.jpg">
            <p>The game begins with the titular character Carto living on 
                her grandmother’s flying ship. Her grandmother has a magical 
                map with tiles that change the shapes of the world’s 
                landmasses. One day, during a storm, Carto falls out of 
                her grandmother’s flying ship, along with the scattered 
                pieces of the world map. Carto must then collect the pieces, 
                put the world back in order, and find a way back to her grandmother’s 
                ship. Along the way Carto makes many wholesome friendships — 
                an adorable story that perfectly matches the adorable art style.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/carto_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>The main gameplay hook is navigating square panels of the world 
                much like the old Zelda games on the Game Boy, only when you pull 
                up the world map in the menu, you have to grab and arrange the tiles 
                yourself. You can rotate and shuffle them in any order you wish, 
                provided that the borders match. If you’ve played board games like 
                Alhambra, Queendomino, or Cartographers, then you’ll know exactly what to do.
                 And even if you haven’t, the game starts out simple enough to ease you into the concept.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/carto_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>Soon you’ll have to solve puzzles by arranging the tiles in a certain way, 
                like making a lake appear by arranging the shores in a circle, or finding 
                your way through foggy woods by placing the tiles in the right directions. 
                There are plenty of new ideas so that you’re never stuck on one concept for 
                too long. Just as you feel like you’ve mastered one mechanic, you’re moving 
                on to the next one. The developers planted the seed of this novel idea, then 
                cultivated it diligently, and finally harvested a ripe fruit of polished gameplay.</P>
