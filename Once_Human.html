            <p>Once Human is a free-to-play post-apocalyptic third-person open world 
                multiplayer survival game. Developed and published by Starry Studio, 
                a NetEase subsidiary, the game was released on July 9, 2024.</p>

            <img src="Images/Survival/oncehuman_scenes1.jpg">
            <p>To be honest, I didn't expect to get into a NetEase survival MMO, 
                initially shrugging it off at as another mobile-first game that would 
                keep me busy for about as long as it took for my fast food order to arrive. 
                I could not have been more wrong. 
            </p>

            <p>Once Human is far from perfect, but it is good. For a free-to-play game, 
                it is stunningly good. Does it break new ground? Not one bit. It's like a 
                less cartoony, more fully-fleshed out version of creature collector Palworld, 
                in that it throws everything people like from other games into one giant bucket.
                 Am I here for that? Absolutely.
            </p>

            <P>Once you're done with the detailed character creation (hairline sliders, anyone?),
                 you'll jump into the game as a "meta-human," a new mutation of homo sapiens that
                  have adapted to alien "stardust" which has turned most of the planet into monsters. 
                  The people who remain are either plucky rebels and pioneers, or evil guards working for
                   the folks that unleashed this plague to begin with.</P>
