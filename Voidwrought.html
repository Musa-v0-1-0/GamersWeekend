            <p>Voidwrought is a 2024 metroidvania game developed by 
                Powersnake and published by Kwalee for 
                Microsoft Windows in October 2024, and for Nintendo 
                Switch in the same year. Players assume control of a caped 
                hero, and are tasked with the riddance of 
                fasle gods from their shrine.</p>

            <p>Voidwrought is a hand-drawn Metroidvania set in a world of cosmic horrors. 
                In most genres, a game with incredible art, deep lore, precise controls, 
                and awesome sound design would make for an unforgettable classic. 
                But in the world with Hollow Knight and Blasphemous, that’s just the bar for entry.</p>

            <p>Swedish developer Powersnake checked all the right Metroidvania boxes 
                when making this game. Voidwrought looks great, controls well, 
                builds a compelling, enigmatic world to explore, and has one of 
                the best soundtracks of the year. It even innovates by adding base-building 
                mechanics and refinements to the menus, most notably in the map section. 
                But even with so much going for it, the game struggles to become more than 
                the sum of its exceptional parts.</p>

            <img src="Images/Metroidvania/void_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>Our hero is a nameless, shapeshifting warrior whose body is 
                made of cape and goo. After centuries of slumber, we’re called to 
                awakening by the whispers of a blood-red star. As soon as we burst 
                free from the sacred ovum, we learn that the hallowed halls of our 
                shrine have been overrun by false gods! To sweep out all the heretics, 
                we’re going to have to slither around the surrounding ruins and look for upgrades to grow our power.</P>
