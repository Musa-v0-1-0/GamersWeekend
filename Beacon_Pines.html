            <p>Beacon Pines is a narrative adventure indie game that 
            was developed by Hiding Spot Games and published by Fellow Traveller.
            The game was released on the 22nd September, 2022 for 
            Microsoft Windows, Nintendo switch and the Xbox One.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/beacon_pines_scenes1.jpg">
            <p>It tells the story of the titular small town and 
                its mysterious past. The tale is told by a magical storybook 
                narrator who needs you, the player, to help find a happy ending 
                for the town and its many inhabitants – especially for 
                Luka Vanhorn, a young deer boy whose parents are gone.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/beacon_pines_scenes2.jpg">
            <p>There are multiple Turning Points, where Luka and company 
                must decide upon a single word to help guide what happens next. 
                Sometimes it’s what someone will say or do, sometimes it’s 
                how something looks or feels. By changing that single word, 
                the tone and direction of the entire realm shifts, and what 
                happens next can be illuminating or damning. More than once, 
                that single choice results in the end of the game, and there 
                are very, very few happy endings in Beacon Pines.</p>

            <img src="Images/Open World/beacon_pines_scenes3.jpg">
            <P>By taking this story and putting you behind the wheel instead 
                of just allowing you to view it, Hiding Spot Games rode an 
                incredibly thin line of interaction and exposition that works 
                on a truly engaging level. There’s enough action to make sure 
                that you’re engaged and not disconnected as the saga winds on, 
                but there’s also plenty of exposition and moments of just taking 
                in information that you’re not perpetually running about.</P>
